## Overview

Yeah, I know the naming isn't great, but whatever, it was an internal tool that is no longer needed.

The main purpose was to easily fill in missing information on our database about all the vehicles.

Most of the available internal information for the 800-something GTA V vehicles at the time was scraped from two different websites, dedicated to GTA vehicles, with obviously two different data structures. So things were missing.

## Features

1. Login using MySQL server credentials
2. Get and Update vehicle information from the MySQL database
3. Retrieve a vehicle image, according to their internal ID name, from `gtabase.com`, upon switching vehicles
